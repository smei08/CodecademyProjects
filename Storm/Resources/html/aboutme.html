          Hello, I'm Storm and I am almost one year's old. There are three
          things I love to do, first is play. I like to play with anything
          that's playable string to feather to my own hair ball. If you throw I
          will play. Second, I love to eat. Maybe I was too spoiled of getting
          too much food when I woas younger, now nothing is enough. I especially
          love these dry chicken treats, I will even throw these paws to get
          some. And lastly, I love to annoying my older bother. Anywhere he's at
          and do I want to be part of.
